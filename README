    - Python (2.5 or newer)
	 - readline
    - swig
    For ChemmineR (configure option: --with-chemminerpp)
       - R
    For lshkit (on by default, turn off with configure option --without-lshkit)
       - libdb
       - boost
       - boost program options
       - boost thread
       - boost threadppool
       - gsl / gslcblas
    For OpenBabel support (configure option: --without-openbabel)
       - openbabel

	 If your on Debian, the following packages should work:
			libreadline-dev libdb-dev libbost-dev libboost-dev libboost-thread1.42.0 libboost-thread1.42-dev 
			libboost-program-options1.42.0 libboost-program-options1.42-dev libgsl0-dev libgsl0ldbl 
			python2.6-dev swig libopenbabel3 libopenbabel-dev r-base
    Note that this list does not include boost threadpool.	


See the INSTALL file for complete directions, a summary is given here. First,
run ./configure. There are three main build options to this.
   a) OpenBabel is on by default, it can be disabled with --without-openbabel
   b) to use the ChemmineRpp R extenstion add --with-chemminerpp
   c) LSH-assisted search is on by default, to disable it add --without-lshkit
See above for the requirements for each of these. If some of the libraries 
are installed in a different location, you can set environment variables to
point to them, see INSTALL for complete details. For example, if boost 
threadpool was installed in /opt/threadpool, you would set CXXFLAGS as follows:
   export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/threadpool"
Then run configure.  Once configure has run, do 'make' and then 'make install'. 
In addition to the normal EI binaries, this will also install ChemmineRpp in R, 
if selected, and a few python packages.
