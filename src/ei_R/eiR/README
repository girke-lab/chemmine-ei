On Windows and Mac the binary libraries for GSL and Boost will need to be
installed. On Linux you will also need the header files for these libraries.
Boost has several components that are often distributed together, but some
linux distributions split them into separate packages. In that case, the
components needed are the base boost libs, 'program_options", and "thread". 

It depends on two external libraries:

1. GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
    1. Linux:  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
    2. Mac:
          https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/math/gsl/Portfile
          https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/math/gsl-devel/Portfile
    3. Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
2. Boost ( >= 1.42.0)
    1. Linux: http://www.boost.org/
    2. Mac: http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=library&substr=boost
    3. Windows:
       http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/more/getting_started/windows.html
